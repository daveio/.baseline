Right-o! Looks like I need permission to fiddle with the shared memory contraption first. These tools are like a locked toolshed - gotta get the key before I can start storing all the delightful details about abseil, adwaita-icon-theme, aha, ali, amfora, antidote, aom, aqua, aria2, and aribb24.

Once you grant me access to the sharedMemory MCP tool, I'll catalog these beauties faster than you can say "package manager"! Each one has its own quirky personality - from abseil's Google-flavored C++ utilities to amfora's charming terminal-based Gemini browsing adventures.
