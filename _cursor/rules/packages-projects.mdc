# Package Management

You can use the `context7` MCP tool to find libraries, frameworks, and snippets which could help you do things. In general, prefer to use a library over attempting to do something manually.

## JavaScript/TypeScript

Use `bun` for package management. In `package.json` scripts, use `bun run` prefix.

If the `package.json` script `cf-typegen` exists, add `types` as an alias to it with `bun run cf-typegen`.

If this is a Cloudflare Worker or `worker-configuration.d.ts` exists, run `bun types` after any modifications to `wrangler.jsonc` or `wrangler.toml` (or any configuration change).

## Python

Use `uv` for project initialization and management. Prefer manager-agnostic directives in package definitions; use `uv`-specific directives only when generic options aren't feasible.
